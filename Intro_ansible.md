# Introduction to _Ansible_

## What is Ansible?

_Ansible_ is an open source automation and orchestration tool for software provisioning, configuration management, and software deployment. Ansible can easily run and configure Unix-like systems as well as Windows systems to provide infrastructure as code. It contains its own declarative programming language for system configuration and management.
